basic logic of the compiler
    [plain text] -> {parser} -> [plain text entities] -> {composer} -> [structured text entities] -> {builder} -> [logic] -> {resolver} -> [runtime]
    [] entities - only holds data and some elementary entity local logic
    {} tasks - all the tasks which somehow modify or create entities, they can also use helper
    [plain text] is the source code
    [plain text entities] are pages composed of lines and tokens
    [structured text entities] are blocks composed of sub-blocks and parts
    [logic] are data structures representing mg objects without references to other mg objects
    [runtime] are the final mg data structures which are executable

resolver:
    variable:
        [output]parent[input]{?}n ... <-connection-> 1[output]expression[input]

    function:
        [output]parent[input]{?}n ... <-connection-> n[output]expression[input]{?}n ... <-connections-> n[output]child[input]
