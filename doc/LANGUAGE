collection polymorphism problem
    ReadableList<Child> can be passed as ReadableList<Parent>
    WriteableList<Child> cannot be passed as WritableList<Parent> !!!

literals - do not allow escape sequences or anything like that
    use special buildin constants or functions
    this will simplify literal handling A LOT
    things like \n \t etc can be handled at cast/convert level (to text)

stamps don't need to hold values, ie there will be no instances
    values can be handled by global variables with inheritance

calling of super method:
    let class FooBar extend Bar and override print function
    instead of fooBar.print
    call Foo.print: fooBar
