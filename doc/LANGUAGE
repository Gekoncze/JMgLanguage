literals
    are convertible to instances of buildin types
    users can provide their own converters for their own types (TODO)
    escape sequences or anything like that are not supported by default
        special buildin constants can be used instead (TODO)
        or you can handle some escapes like \n or \t yourself inside your own converters

stamps
    they are just markers
    they don't hold any values, ie there will be no "stamp instances"
    values can be handled by type variables instead

variables
    global variables are standalone components
    instance variables are used in class instances
    type variables are used in class type instances
