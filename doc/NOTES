        resolve is optional (successful when there is exactly 1 match)

        we are resolving expression, so we don't know its output and input yet
        we might know parent input, so we can filter by that if not null
        we don't know child output, so we cannot filter by that

    resolve children and add children to expression.expressions
        if expression is resolved, then we connect child to expression

    onLeave:
        resolve is mandatory (successful when there is exactly 1 match)

        we are resolving expression, so we don't know its output and input yet
        we might know parent input, so we can filter by that if not null
        we know child output, so we can always filter by that
